## ðŸš€ Backend Deployment (AWS)

Deployed on **AWS** with:

* **AMI** (Spring Boot JAR + JDK 17)
* **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** for scaling
* **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** for traffic
* **RDS (MySQL)** for database
* **Secrets Manager** for DB creds & JWT

**CI/CD flow:** build JAR â†’ bake AMI â†’ refresh ASG â†’ serve via ALB.

All resources were later deleted to avoid charges.
